## Introduction

Part of the 24hour Allstate Datahack 2017 at Ulster University Jordanstown for the team Hold My Beer.


### Competition Description  

Predict the likelihood of an establishment failing a food inspection so the City of Chicago can deploy their food inspectors in the most effective way.

The City of Chicago is required to inspect eating establishments on a regular basis to ensure safety and health standards are met. Given the large number of establishments in the city, and the shortage in qualified food inspectors, the City must use a data-driven approach to identify establishments most at risk of failing an inspection.

There are many factors, from location to past records to license type, which can be analyzed to predict the likelihood of a failed inspection.

Using data from the City of Chicago, the goal of this competition is to predict the likelihood of an establishment failing a food inspection.
